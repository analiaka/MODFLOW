# Simple-MODFLOW
Setting up a simple steady-state well model using MODFLOW, the widely utilized groundwater modeling software developed by the USGS
# MODFLOW Results Visualization

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook tutorial for the essential steps to create and configure a MODFLOW model that simulates groundwater flow under steady-state conditions and visualizing MODFLOW groundwater simulation results.  
The notebook includes:
Creating the model
- DIS Package
- BAS Package
- LPF Package
- WEL PAckage
- OC Package
- PCG Package
Writing files and running the model
Post processing and visualization
- Hydraulic head contours
- Flow vectors (discharge arrows)
- Model grid visualization  

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- FloPy
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- MODFLOW or MODFLOW-2005 executables

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
